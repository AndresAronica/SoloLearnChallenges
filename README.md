# SoloLearnChallenges
Hi! Welcome!
In this repo I will keep the SoloLearn Challenges that I will continue to solve from time to time. The idea of this is:
- Keep practicing new skills,
- Learning new ways to solve different kinds of problems, and
- Being able to consolidate the theoretical study that I do every day, in the best way possible: By practicing!

I will keep them divided in the 3 categories provided by SoloLearn: Easy, Medium and Hard.

Every class represents one challange, and at the top of the class its going to be the Task, Input Format and Output Format.

In case you feel like I can improve my solutions in some way, I encourage you to let me know, so I can keep learning!

In case you have any questions, feel free to ask. You have my contact details in my profile!

Thanks for stopping by!
